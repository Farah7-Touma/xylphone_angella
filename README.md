# xylophone_flutter_angella

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- Course : The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart / Angella / Udemy
- Idea : playing xylophone on mobile
- What I've learned :
  1 - Import sounds Flutter Packages
  2 - Create a widget/function and call it many times , instead of repeating it each time we need it 
  3 - Passing parameters when creating/calling a widget/function
